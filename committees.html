    Committee Policies

  <div style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; line-height: 1.7;">

    <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each committee session.
      Delegates who are absent will have their advisor notified.
      Delegates may not leave their assigned committee or visit other
      committees during unmoderated caucuses.
    </p>

    <h3>Notes Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Delegates are encouraged to bring handwritten or printed notes,
      including their topic guide, to assist them during debate.
      Pre-written materials such as draft resolutions, working papers,
      or crisis notes are not permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any delegate found in possession of pre-written materials will be
      disqualified from awards and their advisor will be informed.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
